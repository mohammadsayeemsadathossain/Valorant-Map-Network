# Valorant-Map-Network
Given distances between all the maps in Valorant, I tried to create a Computer Network connecting all the Routers set within the maps in a way that the packet gets transferred taking the shortest route possible.
There are six maps as of the initial commit, namely: Bind, Breeze, Split, Ascent, Icebox.
The shortest distances to each path is given in the Network Topology Diagram.
The assigned IP Addresses are given in the IP Addressing Table, from the corresponding VLSM Subnetting method used, to use the least number of IP Addresses available.
A public IP Address was assigned to a Server which has been appointed as the main Server, as of now, from where the Data of all maps are stored.
